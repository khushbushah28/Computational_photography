## Saliency
The salient code that was supplied.An image's saliency map and binary version are produced and shown by ipynb. Saliency maps use the image's overall contrast to highlight significant features. Prior to applying thresholding for a binary representation, the code computes the saliency map, computes the global contrast, and converts the image to grayscale. The final pictures are then shown, giving viewers a visual understanding of the unique characteristics of the original picture. By changing the image path to suit their unique use case, users can easily customize the code.
